    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When I made this garlic mashed cauliflower, my husband told me that he sampled some of the "potatoes" while they were still in the skillet, and he said they were really good! So, next time you want to sneak in a vegetable, instead of mashed potatoes, try this for your family dinner table. I won't tell!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 pounds frozen riced cauliflower, thawed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch nutmeg, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter in a large skillet, over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Stir in thawed, riced cauliflower, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.</li>
      <li>Cook, covered, about 8 minutes, then remove cover and continue cooking and stirring until most of the liquid evaporates, an additional 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Use an immersion blender to purée cauliflower until smooth. If an immersion blender is not available, spoon cauliflower into a blender to purée. When smooth, place in a serving bowl and garnish with snipped chives.</li>
    </ol>
